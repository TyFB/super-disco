# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Daily planner for day to day use

## Description

This is a daily planner with time parameters set around my personal lifestyle/work schedule:

- I went into this wanting to further my skills and knowledge of JS and jQuery.
- Not only did I challenge myself with this one but I feel like I understand it even better, with much higher confidents in my skills with JS and jQuery.
- This gives me, one a nice base code I could use further down the line, and two an option of setting up a nice schedule.
- I learned that reading docs is vital but also asking for help when your knowledge is limited is the best way to learn and improve.

## Usage

Simply click next to the hour you want to schedule something then click the sd card to save it to that hour.
